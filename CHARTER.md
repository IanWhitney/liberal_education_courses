# Liberal Education Course Service

This app came out of a conversation between Stacey Tidball (tidball@umn.edu), Katherine Russell (russellk@umn.edu) and the solutions team. OUE and Communications wanted to remove the static lists of Liberal Education classes from the One Stop site and replace them with up-to-date lists of the classes that met LE requirements.

An example page: http://onestop.umn.edu/degree_planning/lib_eds/fall_2010_requirements/civic_life.html

This app serves as the API endpoint that returns data about LE classes. One the One Stop site the pages have a bit of javascript that gets the json and builds an html table.
